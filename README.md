# Research on Links between Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) and Rapid Intensification (RI) of Tropical Cyclones

This repository contains code and analysis related to research on the impact of marine heatwaves on the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones. The project aims to investigate the relationship between ocean temperature anomalies and the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones.

## Projects

This research is divided into three main projects. Each project is associated with a research paper. Currently, only the codes and data related to the first project is publicly available. Details of the research papers are as follows:

### Project 1: Gulf of Mexico (GoM) - Probabilistic Analysis of Rapid Intensification during Marine Heatwaves

**Research Papers:**

1. **First Paper:**
   - **Folder Name:** `GoM_ProbRI-MHW`
   - **Title:** Rapid intensification of tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico is more likely during marine heatwaves
   - **Status:** Accepted for publication in Nature Communications Earth & Environment
   - **Link to the Published Paper:** [Nature Communications Earth & Environment](https://www.nature.com/collections/cgdbbcfjii#:~:text=Weather%20and%20climate%20extremes%20have%20become%20more%20frequent,and%20social%20%28in%29justice%20to%20biodiversity%20and%20ecosystem%20loss.)

2. **Second Paper:**
   - **Title:** Global predictability of marine heatwave induced rapid intensification of tropical cyclones
   - **Status:** Under review in AGU Earth's Future

3. **Third Paper:**
   - **Title:** Under preparation

## Results
The main output of this analysis will be a set of visualizations and statistical analyses exploring the relationship between marine heatwaves and the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones. The results are available in the cited papers.
